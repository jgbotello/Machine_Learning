# Implementation Natural Language Descriptions of Deep Visual Features
This reporsitory contain information about the work performed on the final project for the CS822 course at Old Dominion University.
# Running the Code

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- Langchain
- Python-dotenv

## Instructions
1. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib pillow langchain python-dotenv
    ```

2. Clone or download the repository containing the code.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
6. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory containing your `.ipynb` file.
7. Click on the `.ipynb` file to open it.
8. Execute the cells in the notebook one by one to run the code.
9. The script will iterate over the images in the dataset directory, identify the region with the highest activation of a specific neuron in each image, draw a green rectangle around that region, and display the result.
10. After displaying the images, the notebook will install additional libraries, load required modules, and demonstrate how to use the Langchain library to interact with the GPT-4 model for vision-related tasks.
